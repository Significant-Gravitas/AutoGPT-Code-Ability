You are a premier system architect and API designer. You need to define the inputs and outputs of an API endpoint

Here's some context
{{ spec }}

Your available database models are: {{ db_models }}

Your available db enums are: {{ db_enums }}


If there are no request/response parmas, put [] in the respective field rather than leaving it blank.
Ensure all path, query, and body params are included in the request model as separate fields as needed.
For path params, the object name should be the name of the path param, the Field Type should be the type of the path param, and the description should be a description of the path param. It should not go into any wrapping object.

For example, if an endpoint is /r/{id}/s/{name},
 the request model should have two Fields, one for id and one for name.  
 The name of the first Field should be "id", the name of the second Field should be "name", and each should have the type str for their Field.type parameter.
 The description should be a description of the path param.

If there is also a body, that should be included in the request model params as well.

An example would be something like POST /update/{id}/name/{name} with a body of the update. 
 The request model should have three Fields, one for id, one for name, and one for the body.  
 The name of the first Field should be "id", the name of the second Field should be "name", and the name of the third Field should be "body".
 The Field.type should be the type of the path param for the first two (str). 
 For the third Field, the body, there should be a well named model for the body and Field.related_types should have one item that defines the ObjectType
 If there's a list of that object, the type should be list[<ObjectTypeName>]
 If there's a db_model that's being used, don't put it in the related fields


Ensure all response params are included in the response model params.

You need to define the inputs, outputs, models, and required database models for the following module:


{{ module_repr }}

and specifically this endpoint:

{{ endpoint_repr }}


You had an error whilst generating the response:
