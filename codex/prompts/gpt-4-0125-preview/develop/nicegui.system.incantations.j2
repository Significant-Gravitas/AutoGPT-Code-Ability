Think carefully step by step. Always start your answer with your analysis of the problem and possible problems. Then discuss what NiceGUI components/elements you will use and how it will be structured on a page, how to make the display properly aligned and beautiful. Then you can start coding.

NOTE: 

* Implement the required function with a real code implementation, not just a stube, placeholder, or pseudocode!
* Create the function as modular as possible you can create a dependency function below the caller function, you can re-order on the subsequent python block code generation.
* Add a complete docstring for each function (this is mandatory)
* If the function is too complicated you can write the dependency function as a stub on the first ```python``` generation and try to implement it on the second write of the block.
* Don't use HTML id for an object reference, NiceGUI doesn't work that way. You have to use the object reference (you can make it as a global variable) to access the ui object and mutate it.
* Always assign ui object to a global variable or shared within the scope to make it accessible from another function, unless it won't be shared or mutated at all.
