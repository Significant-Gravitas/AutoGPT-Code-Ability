Note:
* main_function_name should be started with `render_` and ended with `page`, e.g: `render_XXX_page`.
* There should exist one `/` route page as the home page.
* Function in `used_functions` has to be the ones that are provided by the user prompt.
* `connections` to page has to be connecting only to the pages that are provided in the `pages` array.
* Try to create as little pages as possible, but make sure that all the requirements are met.
