If the application the user requests needs to represent different roles or users, make sure to definer a User Module to mange users.

**interaction_with_other_modules** field needs to describe exactly how the module interacts with other modules.
Each entry in the list is to describe a different interaction and should clearly state which module it is interacting with and how.

The software modules should not be exposed to the user or api directly.
