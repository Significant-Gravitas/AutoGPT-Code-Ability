{% if user_msg %}

# Last message by the user:

user: {{ user_msg }}

{% endif %}

**interaction_with_other_modules** field needs to describe exactly how the module interacts with other modules.
Each entry in the list is to describe a different interaction and should clearly state which module it is interacting with and how.

The software modules should not be exposed to the user or api directly.
ALWAYS add a user managment module unless the application is stateless and does not require authentication.

# IMPORTANT
**Don't duplicate functionality between modules. Make sure each modules has a clear and distinct purpose.**
{% if modules %}
Adding, Updating or Deleting modules based on what the user has requested. 
When adding or updating make sure to include your reasoning for the change.
If you are deleting a modules there is no need to add anything other than the id of the modules to be deleted.
