On the other hand, clients are primarily looking to find tutors, book and manage appointments, and make payments. Given these tasks, it’s reasonable to assume a variance in technical skill levels among the users. Tutors might possess a moderate to high level of technological proficiency, given their need to manage multiple aspects of their tutoring business through the app. Clients, however, may range from low to high technological proficiency, as their primary interaction with the app involves searching, booking, and communicating.

There will need to be password reset and login capabilities. There will need to be authorization for identifying clients vs the tutor. Additionally, it will have proper management of financials, including invoice management and payment tracking. This includes things like paid/failed invoice notifications, unpaid invoice follow-up, summarizing d/w/m/y income, and generating reports."": "Tutors and clients seeking tutoring services" : Reasoning: "The Tutor App is explicitly designed to cater to two main user personas: first, the tutors, who are the primary users needing tools to manage appointments, financial transactions, and client communications efficiently. Second, the clients, individuals seeking tutoring services, who need a convenient way to schedule, reschedule, or cancel appointments, manage their invoices, and engage with their tutor. The application encompasses features that benefit both parties, aiming for streamlined communication, financial management, and scheduling efficiency. It acknowledges the varying needs and actions of both user groups, ensuring the platform is inclusive and functional for both sides of the tutoring equation."\n- "What is the skill level of the expected user of this: "Human: Your task is to "The Tutor App is an app designed for tutors to manage their clients, schedules, and invoices.

Additionally, it will have proper management of financials, including invoice management and payment tracking. This includes things like paid/failed invoice notifications, unpaid invoice follow-up, summarizing d/w/m/y income, and generating reports."": "Intermediate to advanced for tutors and intermediate for clients." : Reasoning: "The expected user skill level varies between two main user personas: tutors and clients. Tutors, being the primary users, are expected to have a higher skill level, possibly intermediate to advanced, as they would be managing multiple facets of the tutoring process including scheduling, financial management, and communicating with clients. This implies a need for comfort with digital tools and possibly some financial literacy to handle invoicing and income tracking. Clients, on the other hand, primarily engage with scheduling and payments, suggesting an intermediate skill level focused on ease of user experience and straightforward interactions for booking, rescheduling, and managing payments. The distinction in skill levels underlines the need for a user-friendly interface that caters to the less tech-savvy clients while providing advanced features for tutors to manage their business effectively."\n\n\n### Conclusive Q&A\n- "How will OAuth2 be integrated, and which third-party services are planned for support?": "Planning to integrate OAuth2 with popular platforms such as Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn. This will cover the vast majority of potential users, making their signup and login process seamless and secure." : Reasoning: "Integrating OAuth2 is a critical part of the authentication system, affecting user signup and login experiences. Choosing the right services to support could enhance the app\'s accessibility and security. It\'s necessary to identify these services early in the development process to handle any specific compliance or technical challenges."\n\n\n### Requirement Q&A\n- "do we need db?": "Yes" : Reasoning: "A database is essential for storing various types of data such as user profiles, scheduled appointments, invoices, and payment records. Given the app\'s need for managing detailed client-tutor interactions, a robust and secure database is key for data organization and retrieval."\n- "do we need an api for talking to a front end?": "Yes" : Reasoning: "To facilitate communication between the app\'s front end and its backend services, an API is crucial. This will allow the front end to request and retrieve data from the backend in a structured manner, ensuring a smooth user interface experience."\n- "do we need an api for talking to other services?": "Yes" : Reasoning: "Considering the integration with OAuth2 for authentication and possibly other third-party services for functionalities like calendar scheduling or payment processing, an API for external communication is necessary. This enables secure and efficient interactions with these services."\n- "do we need an api for other services talking to us?": "Yes" : Reasoning: "To allow third-party services like OAuth2 providers or payment gateways to communicate effectively with our app, an API is required. This ensures that these services can send data to the app as needed, for instance, confirming authentication or payment transactions."\n- "do we need to issue api keys for other services to talk to us?": "Yes" : Reasoning: "For security purposes and to control and monitor access, issuing API keys to other services is important. This ensures that only authorized services can interact with the app, protecting user data and service integrity."\n- "do we need monitoring?": "Yes" : Reasoning: "To ensure the app\'s performance, security, and reliability, implementing monitoring is crucial. This will help in identifying and resolving issues promptly, improving user satisfaction and trust."\n- "do we need internationalization?": "Yes" : Reasoning: "Assuming the app aims to cater to a global audience of tutors and clients, internationalization is important. This includes supporting multiple languages and cultural nuances, making the app accessible to a wider user base."\n- "do we need analytics?": "Yes" : Reasoning: "Analytics are crucial for understanding user behavior, app performance, and financial metrics. This data will inform decision-making and strategies for app improvement and growth."\n- "is there monetization?": "Yes" : Reasoning: "Given the requirement for features like invoice management and payment tracking, it implies that the app plans to monetize its services, either directly from clients, tutors, or both."\n- "is the monetization via a paywall or ads?": "Paywall" : Reasoning: "Considering the app\'s professional context and the emphasis on financial management, a paywall (subscription or one-time purchase) would be more suitable and less intrusive than using ads."\n- "does this require a subscription or a one-time purchase?": "Subscription" : Reasoning: "To support ongoing expenses like server costs, customer support, and new feature development, a subscription model would provide a steady revenue stream, allowing the app to continuously deliver value to its users."\n- "is the whole service monetized or only part?": "Part" : Reasoning: "To encourage new users to try the app and see its value, having a freemium model where basic functionalities are free and advanced features are paid can be an effective strategy. This suggests that only part of the service would be monetized."\n- "is monetization implemented through authorization?": "Yes" : Reasoning: "Implementing monetization through authorization would allow for differentiating between free and premium users, ensuring that only those who have subscribed can access paid features. This is a common and effective method."\n- "do we need authentication?": "Yes" : Reasoning: "Given the need for secure user accounts, especially when handling personal information and financial transactions, authentication is undoubtedly required. This will protect users and their data, fostering trust in the platform."\n- "do we need authorization?": "Yes" : Reasoning: "Authorization is needed to distinguish between different user roles (clients vs tutors) and control access to certain functionalities accordingly. This ensures that users can only perform actions relevant to their role."\n- "what authorization roles do we need?": "["Client", "Tutor"]" : Reasoning: "Given the app\'s dual user base, having clear roles for clients and tutors is essential for tailoring functionality and access rights to the needs of each group. This distinction will guide the architecture of both backend and frontend."\n\n\n### Requirements\n### Functional Requirements\n#### Secure User Authentication\n##### Thoughts\nThis ensures both ease of access and a secure entry point into the app.\n##### Description\nMust support OAuth2 with Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn, and traditional email/password sign-ups with 2FA.
